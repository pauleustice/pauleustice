Hi, I’m @pauleustice. I'm an Engineering Manager on the Frontend Platform team at Legal & General. I have a background in developing complex Web applications, primarily in Angular.

These days I’m mostly interested in platform-level CI tooling, envisioning and developing enterprise-grade tools to support monorepo maintenance and deployment.

You can find me on [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauleustice).
